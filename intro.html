        Tourists, generally, get cheated financially either it be through high auto fares or by buying goods that are sold at double price to them. Tourists don’t know which is the best and cheapest way possible to reach a tourist spot i.e., either it is by bus or auto or one can reach there by simply walking. They sometimes feel out of place because they don’t know what to wear to a tourist spot because they don’t have knowledge about that place. They don’t even know which is the best time to visit a place. Often, tourists visiting multiple places end up wasting a lot of time in travelling from one place to another just because they don’t know an efficient route to visit all places.
